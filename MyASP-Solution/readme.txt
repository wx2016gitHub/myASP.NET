This demo is to demonstrate my understanding ASP.NET. 
I added a navigation bar named MyASP to verify the controller and Route configuration. 
MyASP is a controller. In controller directory, I added a controller file that is named MyAPSController.cs to 
handle data views, edit, detail, remove and Also add an interface page in View directory. 
I also added classes file MyASPData.cs under the Models directory that includes a demo data set which
 Also uses the same database tables. The photoID field in this demo was designed to save a pID which 
is associated with a real picture that saves under directory MySource. 
I only made 30 photos (p01~p30) available. I created two files myCSS.css and myJquery.js under the directory MySource to 
demonstrate how ASP.NET bundles to the user defined CSS and JQquery files. I redesigned the Home page and About page to
use my own layout and decoration. All the pictures are handled by JQuery codes. My designs are all based on 
the component of ASP.NET, bootstrap3, CSS, HTML and JQuery. The data is saved in an SQL database except the images. 
The purpose is to understand basic ASP.NET knowledge. The code base and tests were built in Visual Studio community 2015 and SQL server 2014.
